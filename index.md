SleePi is a real-time alert system and its function is to record the driver's drowsiness by using a camera which will observe the driver’s eyes, then alert them if they feel sleepy and also closing the eyes for long.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Sathvikdevineni/Sleep-Pi/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
