# SleePi
Real Time Embedded Project
## ABOUT
SleePi is a real-time alert system for the drivers, its major function is predominantly to screen the driver's laziness condition and distraction condition. SleePi is a low-cost prototype that can be easily implemented in the practical world which all the time observe the drivers, alert them if they feel sleepy and give ready warning to the driver when the driver is negligent continuously. As it is a real-time project which enhances safety-critical applications, so it required high accuracy when observing the driver. Hence different methodologies are used on deduction times and exhibit the viability of ongoing observing dependent on out-of-test information to caution a sleepy driver. So we can say that SleePi step towards the pragmatic profound learning applications, possibly forestalling miniature dozes and decreasing street injury.

## HARDWARE
- Raspberry Pi
- 5MP Camera Module OV5647

## SOFTWARE




## METHODOLOGY
The first and foremost step is to acquires a video from the camera connected with the Raspberry Pi. We resized the obtained video from its current size to 640x480, and we convert it to grayscale, appropriate for ongoing handling. From there on, the facial tourist spots like eyebrows, nose, mouth, eyes and facial structure were gotten. The eyes were then confined to ascertain the PERCLOS, which depends on the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR). The EAR was obtained once during the calibration time frame, at the framework set-up time, which was utilized as the laziness limit in the system. Afterward, during the excursion, the EAR for both the driver's eyes will be determined, for each edge, to decide the driver's condition. Additionally, the head present is obtained to decide whether the driver is mindful or oblivious. The languor discovery and the careless identification works in equal and an alert will be set off when either:
1. The EAR surpasses the sluggishness edge, or
2. The driver head present isn't looking forward.
