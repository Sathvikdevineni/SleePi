# SleePi
Real Time Embedded Project
## ABOUT
SleePi is a real-time alert system for the drivers, its major function is predominantly to screen the driver's laziness condition and distraction condition. SleePi is a low-cost prototype that can be easily implemented in the practical world which all the time observe the drivers, alert them if they feel sleepy and give ready warning to the driver when the driver is negligent continuously. As it is a real-time project which enhances safety-critical applications, so it required high accuracy when observing the driver. Hence different methodologies are used on deduction times and exhibit the viability of ongoing observing dependent on out-of-test information to caution a sleepy driver. So we can say that SleePi step towards the pragmatic profound learning applications, possibly forestalling miniature dozes and decreasing street injury.
